When a boat was sinking into the sea
When someone was turning into a mystery
You didn't understand why those people were leaving
And you didn't know the "goodbye" would be their last word when you were listening

When a vehicle was vanishing at the horizon
When the existence of someone was being forgotten
You had no clue what made them leave so suddenly
Just like you not believing that it was the end of the story

After all those nights when the stars abandon the galaxy
I would leave and say goodbye to myself eventually
Since I didn't know and didnâ€™t even bother to know
How soon the next encounter with them would be

After the Milky Way has fallen into the deep valley
I would wake up and forget everything that happened in my dream
What you didn't know and would never know
Is the fact that the past has elapsed already

When the boat has sunk into the sea
When someone has turned into a mystery
You still refuse to think about why they were leaving
Just like you refusing to believe the "goodbye" was the last word they were saying

When the vehicle has vanished at the horizon
When the existence of someone has been forgotten
You still can't figure out the reason why they were leaving
But at least you realize all you needed was no more than a happy ending
