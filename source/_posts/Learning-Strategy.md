1. 切忌本末倒置
   Understand how a theorem or method is applied (what it is used for and what each parameter means in a formula) prior to understanding how it is derived.
   Reasoning (i.e. knowing the procedures behind it) should only be a way to help students to better use the theorem or method, otherwise it will be extremely time-consuming and mislead students away from the true essence of engineering - applied science.

2. 不可纸上谈兵
   Start solving problems once knowing the basics of a concept.
   This is when students apply the concept and start to see different scenarios, which is closer to the real situations they will encounter in their future career.

3. 归纳总结与融会贯通
   Keep summarizing and connecting all your knowledge to build enormous network.
   These two ways help students learn new knowledge faster, just like the mechanism of machine learning - the more knowledge it intakes, the smarter the AI would be.

4. 多种方法相辅相成
   Utilize supplementary resources.
   As a result of the fast development of the internet, it is not unusual for students to find a video online that explains a concept much more clear than their professor. YouTube videos, PDF textbooks and online articles tend to be increasingly useful tools that help university students understand various topics, especially in such pandemic time when professors become more undependable. Students should never reply on their professors only, but also all these resources that are available to them.
